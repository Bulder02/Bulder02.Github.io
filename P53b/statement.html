  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Static art relays a strong and singular emotion in the viewer, the drama exists eternally. Rembrandtâ€™s Storm on the sea of Galilee will never know calm waters. When art is moving the action emotes a story, it presents and defines itself for the viewer. As it goes you see the timer ticking down till the art is done. Developing the static, the unyielding in video is the dream for creation when artwork moves in front of you. I desire a story that resonates with the viewer with a message that will stay staring at you as strong as the stare in a portrait.</p>
  <p>I work to develop videos and images that hold singular ideas that resonate with a diverse audience. Creating my story is only the beginning as the message is kept loose and open to interpretation to the viewers mind, allowing my artwork to expand and find its own meaning. I want multiple avenues and mediums for my designs so I never will lead myself down a singular path and lock my work in.
