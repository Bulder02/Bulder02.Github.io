      <p> The pelt of light water has dramatic effects on what is around us, the restful rythyms ease us into a relaxed state, but their build up has large impacts that can soetimes only be seen overtime. Yet the reaction is often immediate and jolts into action as intense as a fire. We should rest in it's soothing embrace yet be mindful that all things can have great results.</p>
