  <h1>Arid Water</h1>
  <p> Water is the building block for us in many ways, and we need it in all walks of life. In play, in work, and to live, water is one of the key ingredients to how we exist. Water however is a natural resource and its availability to everyone is not guaranteed anymore. We need the reminders, as often as possible that water is not unlimited; access is no longer something we can take for granted. It is something that the whole world needs and what is here we must learn to manage and save for everyone and anything alive around us.</p>
